# 🏎️ KR-02 Codebase

## Project Overview

This repository contains the **Vehicle Control Unit (VCU)** software developed for the **KR-02** electric vehicle, prepared for the FS Alpe Adria 2025 and FS Türkiye 2025 competition.

## System Architecture

The system is built around a custom-designed Vehicle Control Unit (VCU) based on the **STM32F407VGT7** microcontroller. Sensor data (including throttle, brake, speed, and gyroscope readings) is acquired through a combination of **analog-to-digital converters (ADC)**, **digital GPIOs**, and **CAN communication**. The microcontroller processes these signals in real time, applies application-specific logic, and logs selected data to an onboard **microSD card** using a **FATFS-based SPI interface**. In parallel, relevant information is transmitted via **UART** to a **Nextion HMI display**, providing the driver with a live data interface. Additionally, the VCU handles control of safety-critical and state-based systems such as the **Ready-to-Drive (R2D)** signal via dedicated output lines and internal state machines.
